# Machine Learning Web Application with Streamlit and PyCaret

## Overview

This repository contains a Python script for building a web application with Streamlit for data exploration, profiling, modeling, and predictions using PyCaret for machine learning tasks. The application allows users to upload datasets, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), train regression models, and make predictions.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/RyanAlmasu/MachineLearning.git
    cd your-repo
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the Streamlit application:

    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

## Usage

### Upload Dataset

Choose the "Upload" option in the sidebar and use the file uploader to upload your dataset. The uploaded dataset will be saved as `dataset.csv`.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Select the "Profiling" option to perform exploratory data analysis using Pandas Profiling. The generated report will be displayed in the Streamlit app.

### Modeling

1. Choose the "Modelling" option.
2. Select the target column for regression.
3. Click the "Run Modelling" button.
4. The application will train regression models using PyCaret and display the best model along with setup and comparison results.

### Predictions

1. Select the "Predictions" option.
2. Ensure that the best model has been generated by running the "Modelling" step.
3. Click the "Run Predictions" button to make predictions on the uploaded dataset.
4. The predictions will be displayed, and the results will be saved as `predictions.csv`.

## Additional Information

- The code includes a progress bar during the modeling step, but it progresses in fixed steps (25%, 50%, 100%) rather than dynamically based on the progress of the modeling steps.
- Note: There is an unnecessary import (`from operator import index`) and a redundant check for the existence of `./dataset.csv` in the "Predictions" step.

Feel free to explore and customize the code according to your requirements!
